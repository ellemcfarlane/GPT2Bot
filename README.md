# GPT-2 Bot
Interact with this bot on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/Gpt2B). It uses GPT-2 to formulate response.

The randomness of its response is influenced by certain, secret words...

For example, if the word frozen is mentioned, it's response randomness is set to 0 (min), and if coffee is mentioned, it is set to 1.0 (max).
